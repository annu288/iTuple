          medical record reviews, which help us in better assessment and

        <h4>Evolving to a better solution</h4>
        <p>
          As a Startup begins to scale and cater to larger volumes, the
          technology built in the initial days requires complete overhaul and
          re-architecting. In 2018, with volumes increasing every day and
          transactions hitting 1 million+ per month, a more robust, and scalable
          solution was the need of the hour. We engaged iTuple and helped us
          move away from our monolith application to a microservice
          architecture, and build a faster, scalable, and more reliable
          platform. Not only this, they also helped us move our non-core
          business flow to an event-based architecture. Overall, today our
          systems are scalable and able to cater to 10x the volume without any
          hiccup.
